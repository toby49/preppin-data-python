# Preppin' Data Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Preppin' Data challenges, using Python and pandas. Through these challenges, I've practised various techniques, including cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets.

## Key Skills Practised:
- **Data Import**: Reading CSV and Excel files using `pd.read_csv()` and `pd.read_excel()`.
- **Data Transformation**: Handling column splits, renaming columns, and parsing dates.
- **Merging and Concatenation**: Joining dataframes using `pd.concat()` and `pd.merge()`.
- **Data Aggregation**: Using `groupby()`, pivot tables, and various aggregation functions.
- **Conditional Operations**: Filtering data and replacing values.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converting columns to the appropriate data types.

## Challenges Completed:
1. Week 1: Cleaning and transforming data.
2. Week 2: Data aggregation by multiple factors.
3. Week 3: Merging and analyzing target and sales data.
4. Week 4: Handling seat bookings and a seating plan data set in order to find available seats.
